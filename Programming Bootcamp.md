# Programming Bootcamp

This programming question must be completed in Python. Upload your code to Pastebin, GitHub Gists or a similar code sharing service, and provide the link to the code below. 

This is not an opportunity to show off your skills in programming, but rather an assessment of your ability to clearly and effectively solve a simple programming problem in a simple and clear way. Remember, our goal is to teach students with no experience, not scare them off!

2. Find all pairs of numbers in the list whose product is even and whose sum is odd.
